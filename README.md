It gets the average return on investment per pokmeon pack and their probablity of getting a card worth as much as the pack.

It was started on anger when I brought a booster box of Booster Packs(36 of Them) and when I opened the packs up I only recieved around 30 Dollars worth of Cards.
I started to collect all the Market values for each card within the set on Pokemon TCG. I scraped the market Prices for each card in the set and price of the booster
pack and their pull rates for each card and put the data in a dataframe
